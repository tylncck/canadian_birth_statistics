# Canadian Birth Statistics
In this project, my purpose was to use Statistics Canada's wide range of Birth Database to explore changing trends and patterns in Canada's Birth Statistics. Additionally, by creating interactive visuals in Plotly and Plotly Chart Studio, I wrote and article depending on the insights taken from the data analysis.  

## 1. Data Source: 
Statistics Canada has a rich database regarding Birth Statistics with an open license. Using the stats_can python package, it is quite simple to collect data with no issues. [Data Source](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/220928/dq220928d-cansim-eng.htm) 

## 2. Plotly Chart Studio
In order to save the interactive visuals and then use them as embedded to medium.com, I used [Plotly Chart Studio](https://chart-studio.plotly.com/feed/#/). In order to use the API, you will need to get an API user, key and token. In this project, I used a config.ini file to store them. 

## 3. The Article
After completing the data analysis part, I wrote an article to discuss my results. The article: [Birth Statistics of Canada](https://medium.com/@cicek.onurtaylan/birth-statistics-of-canada-5b049122a030).
